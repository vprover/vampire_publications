# Artifact Evaluation

This file explains how to build and run the various tools discussed in the NFM 2022 submission 
"Lemmaless Induction in Trace Logic". Following the instructions the experimental results 
attained by the Rapid framework are fully verifiable.

The benchmarks that we use along with their C equivalents can be found at:

https://github.com/vprover/rapid/tree/ahmed-induction-support/examples/arrays

We also include a number of benchmarks with false assertions to show the soundness of our 
implementation:



Build and run RAPID to convert the benchmarks from .spec files to first-order logic
theorem proving problems expressed in SMTLIB (.smt2) files. This step is optional
and if you wish to directly run Vampire, the SMTLIB benchmarks are located:
